<h1>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FEATURES OF C</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C is the widely used language. It provides many&nbsp;<strong>features</strong>&nbsp;that are given below.</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Machine Independent or Portable</li>
<li>Mid-level programming language</li>
<li>structured programming language</li>
<li>Rich Library</li>
<li>Memory Management</li>
<li>Fast Speed</li>
<li>Pointers</li>
<li>Recursion</li>
<li>Extensible</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="h2">1) Simple</h2>
<p>C is a simple language in the sense that it provides a&nbsp;<strong>structured approach</strong>&nbsp;(to break the problem into parts),&nbsp;<strong>the rich set of library functions</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>data types</strong>, etc.</p>
<hr />
<h2 class="h2">2) Machine Independent or Portable</h2>
<p>Unlike assembly language, c programs&nbsp;<strong>can be executed on different machines</strong>&nbsp;with some machine specific changes. Therefore, C is a machine independent language.</p>
<hr />
<h2 class="h2">3) Mid-level programming language</h2>
<p>Although, C is&nbsp;<strong>intended to do low-level programming</strong>. It is used to develop system applications such as kernel, driver, etc. It&nbsp;<strong>also supports the features of a high-level language</strong>. That is why it is known as mid-level language.</p>
<hr />
<h2 class="h2">4) Structured programming language</h2>
<p>C is a structured programming language in the sense that&nbsp;<strong>we can break the program into parts using functions</strong>. So, it is easy to understand and modify. Functions also provide code reusability.</p>
<hr />
<h2 class="h2">5) Rich Library</h2>
<p>C&nbsp;<strong>provides a lot of inbuilt functions</strong>&nbsp;that make the development fast.</p>
<hr />
<h2 class="h2">6) Memory Management</h2>
<p>It supports the feature of&nbsp;<strong>dynamic memory allocation</strong>. In C language, we can free the allocated memory at any time by calling the&nbsp;<strong>free()</strong>&nbsp;function.</p>
<hr />
<h2 class="h2">7) Speed</h2>
<p>The compilation and execution time of C language is fast since there are lesser inbuilt functions and hence the lesser overhead.</p>
<hr />
<h2 class="h2">8) Pointer</h2>
<p>C provides the feature of pointers. We can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers. We&nbsp;<strong>can use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array</strong>, etc.</p>
<hr />
<h2 class="h2">9) Recursion</h2>
<p>In C, we&nbsp;<strong>can call the function within the function</strong>. It provides code reusability for every function. Recursion enables us to use the approach of backtracking.</p>
<hr />
<h2 class="h2">10) Extensible</h2>
<p>C language is extensible because it&nbsp;<strong>can easily adopt new features</strong>.</p>
