<h1 class="h1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Algorithm&nbsp;</h1>
<p>An algorithm is a procedure having well defined steps for solving a particular problem. Algorithm is finite set of logic or instructions, written in order for accomplish the certain predefined task. It is not the complete program or code, it is just a solution (logic) of a problem, which can be represented either as an informal description using a Flowchart or Pseudo code.</p>
<p>The major categories of algorithms are given below:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Sort:</strong>&nbsp;Algorithm developed for sorting the items in certain order.</li>
<li><strong>Search:</strong>&nbsp;Algorithm developed for searching the items inside a data structure.</li>
<li><strong>Delete:</strong>&nbsp;Algorithm developed for deleting the existing element from the data structure.</li>
<li><strong>Insert:</strong>&nbsp;Algorithm developed for inserting an item inside a data structure.</li>
<li><strong>Update:</strong>&nbsp;Algorithm developed for updating the existing element inside a data structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The performance of algorithm is measured on the basis of following properties:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Time complexity:</strong>&nbsp;It is a way of representing the amount of time needed by a program to run to the completion.</li>
<li><strong>Space complexity:</strong>&nbsp;It is the amount of memory space required by an algorithm, during a course of its execution. Space complexity is required in situations when limited memory is available and for the multi user system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each algorithm must have:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Specification:</strong>&nbsp;Description of the computational procedure.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-conditions:</strong>&nbsp;The condition(s) on input.</li>
<li><strong>Body of the Algorithm:</strong>&nbsp;A sequence of clear and unambiguous instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Post-conditions:</strong>&nbsp;The condition(s) on output.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;Design an algorithm to multiply the two numbers x and y and display the result in z.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Step 1 START</li>
<li>Step 2 declare three integers x, y &amp; z</li>
<li>Step 3 define values of x &amp; y</li>
<li>Step 4 multiply values of x &amp; y</li>
<li>Step 5 store the output of step 4 in z</li>
<li>Step 6 print z</li>
<li>Step 7 STOP</li>
</ul>
<p>. Alternatively the algorithm can be written as ?</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Step 1 START MULTIPLY</li>
<li>Step 2 get values of x &amp; y</li>
<li>Step 3 z&larr; x * y</li>
<li>Step 4 display z</li>
<li>Step 5 STOP</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Characteristics of an Algorithm</h3>
<p>An algorithm must follow the mentioned below characteristics:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Input:</strong>&nbsp;An algorithm must have 0 or well defined inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong>&nbsp;An algorithm must have 1 or well defined outputs, and should match with the desired output.</li>
<li><strong>Feasibility:</strong>&nbsp;An algorithm must be terminated after the finite number of steps.</li>
<li><strong>Independent:</strong>&nbsp;An algorithm must have step-by-step directions which is independent of any programming code.</li>
<li><strong>Unambiguous:</strong>&nbsp;An algorithm must be unambiguous and clear. Each of their steps and input/outputs must be clear and lead to only one meaning.</li>
</ul>
