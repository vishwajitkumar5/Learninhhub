<h1><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HISTORY OF JAVA</strong></span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Java was originally developed by&nbsp;<strong>James Gosling</strong>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<em>Sun Microsystems</em>&nbsp;(which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems&rsquo; Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Oracle Corporation</em>&nbsp;is the current owner of the official implementation of the Java SE platform, following their acquisition of Sun Microsystems on January 27, 2010. This implementation is based on the original implementation of Java by Sun. The Oracle implementation is available for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Oracle implementation is packaged into two different distributions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</strong>&nbsp;which contains the parts of the Java SE platform required to run Java programs and is intended for end users.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Java Development Kit (JDK)</strong>&nbsp;which is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as the Java compiler, Javadoc, Jar, and a debugger.</span></li>
