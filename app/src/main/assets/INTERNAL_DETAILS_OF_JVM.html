<h1>INTERNAL DETAILS OF JVM</h1>
<p>JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.</p>
<p>JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (i.e. JVM is platform dependent).</p>
<h3 class="h2">What is JVM</h3>
<p>It is:</p>
<ol class="points">
<li><strong>A specification</strong>&nbsp;where working of Java Virtual Machine is specified. But implementation provider is independent to choose the algorithm. Its implementation has been provided by Oracle and other companies.</li>
<li><strong>An implementation</strong>&nbsp;Its implementation is known as JRE (Java Runtime Environment).</li>
<li><strong>Runtime Instance</strong>&nbsp;Whenever you write java command on the command prompt to run the java class, an instance of JVM is created.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="h2">What it does</h3>
<p>The JVM performs following operation:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Loads code</li>
<li>Verifies code</li>
<li>Executes code</li>
<li>Provides runtime environment</li>
</ul>
<p>JVM provides definitions for the:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Memory area</li>
<li>Class file format</li>
<li>Register set</li>
<li>Garbage-collected heap</li>
<li>Fatal error reporting etc.</li>
</ul>
