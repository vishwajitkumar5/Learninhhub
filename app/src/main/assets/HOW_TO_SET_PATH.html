<h1>HOW TO SET PATH</h1>
<p>The path is required to be set for using tools such as javac, java, etc.</p>
<p>If you are saving the Java source file inside the JDK/bin directory, the path is not required to be set because all the tools will be available in the current directory.</p>
<p>However, if you have your Java file outside the JDK/bin folder, it is necessary to set the path of JDK.</p>
<p>There are two ways to set the path in Java:</p>
<ol class="points">
<li>Temporary</li>
<li>Permanent</li>
</ol>
