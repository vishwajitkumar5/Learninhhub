<h1>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C VS JAVA</h1>
<p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The major differences between C and JAVA.</p>
<p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">1. JAVA is Object-Oriented while C is procedural. Different Paradigms, that is.</p>
<p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Most differences between the features of the two languages arise due to the use of different programming paradigms. C breaks down to functions while JAVA breaks down to Objects. C is more procedure-oriented while JAVA is data-oriented.</p>
<p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">2. Java is an Interpreted language while C is a compiled language.</p>
<p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">We all know what a compiler does. It takes your code &amp; translates it into something the machine can understand-that is to say-0 &amp; 1&rsquo;s-the machine-level code. That&rsquo;s exactly what happens with our C code-it gets &lsquo;compiled&rsquo;. While with JAVA, the code is first transformed to what is called the byte code. This byte code is then executed by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). For the same reason, JAVA code is more portable.</p>
<p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">3. C is a low-level language while JAVA is a high-level language.</p>
<p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">C is a low-level language (difficult interpretation for the user, closer significance to the machine-level code) while JAVA is a high-level language (abstracted from the machine-level details, closer significance to the program itself).</p>
<p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">4. C uses the top-down {sharp &amp; smooth} approach while JAVA uses the bottom-up {on the rocks} approach.</p>
<p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">In C, formulating the program begins by defining the whole and then splitting them into smaller elements. JAVA (and C++ and other OOP languages) follows the bottom-up approach where the smaller elements combine together to form the whole.</p>
<p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">5. Pointer go backstage in JAVA while C requires explicit handling of pointers.</p>
<p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">When it comes to JAVA, we don&rsquo;t need the *&rsquo;s &amp; &amp;&rsquo;s to deal with pointers &amp; their addressing. More formally, there is no pointer syntax required in JAVA. It does what it needs to do. While in JAVA, we do create references for objects.</p>
